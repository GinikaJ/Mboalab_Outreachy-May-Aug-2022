## Task 1 - Data Collection Tool

I believe the most appropriate data collection tool for this project is a **Questionnaire**.

I decided to use [***KoBo Toolbox***](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/) to create my questionnaire for the following reasons:
- This tool allows data collection both online and offline, so in case the internet is unreliable then data collection wil not be halted or interrupted (which i think is an important attribute based on the location of the study).

- It is a free open-source tool that is available to everyone so there are no costs involved.

- **KoBo Toolbox** is very versatile. It allows you to collect data in the field using mobile devices such as mobile phones or tablets, as well as with paper or computers.

- Also, it allows for multiple languages to be deployed on the same form. 

- Lastly, a fill-in pdf file can be created from the form as an alternative
OR
- The pdf form can be printed, filled, scanned back into a database and the data scraped and analysed.




## **Questionnaires** 

I created 2 questionnaires:
 - The Mboalab Typhoid Questionnaire - for prospective data
 - The Mboalab Typhois Questionnaire (Retrospective) - for retrospective data

#### ***The Mboalab Typhoid Questionnaire***
The first questionnaire is a prospective one to be deployed in oupatient setting for new patients presenting with typhoid.
 It's been broken down into 4 headings
- Health Facility Information
- Health Care Professional Information
- Participant's Information
- Case Information
    -Symptoms
    -Health-seeking behaviour
    -Risk Factors
    -Physical Examination

I used skip logic to create the form so when certain answers are chosen then more pop up.

Here is the link to the form - [*The Mboalab Typhoid Questionnaire*](https://ee.kobotoolbox.org/preview/NOLIfOKd)  
Here is a pdf version to see what it looks like (the skip logic questions are faded out in the pdf version) -

#### ***The Mboalab Typhoid Questionnaire (Retrospective)***
The second questionnaire is a retrospective one to be deployed using the Health Faciity's records for patients with typhoid in their database/records.
 It's been broken down to 4 headings
- Health Facility Information
- Health Care Professional Information
- Origin of Data
- Participant's Information
- Case Information

I also used skip logic to create the form so when certain answers are chosen then more pop up.

#### The aim of the retrospective questionnaire is to find out:
- the prevalence of typhoid in the region of study
- the number of admissions for typhoid yearly
- if there is an annual/seasonal occurrence of typhoid in the region
- if there is a high recurrence of typhoid in previous carriers of the disease.

#### Suggestions
- To get feedback from the community:
    - a focus group should be made and the questionnaires deployed to test them out.
- Questionnaires should be translated to french and any other prevalent language in the region (which Kobo allows).
